# JS-Codewars-Solved

This repository is intended to simplify how to approach this problems and problems in general for
beginners who are getting started with Javascript.

Feel free to fork this repo and make pull requests to add your own trained codewars KATA with
a simple explanation on how the problem is solved.
Also, make pull requests if you think an explanation can be better.

This is also a challenge to those that know Javascript already to see how best they can express
that understanding of Javascript. Remember, if you can explain it to a child and he/she understands,
then you know it well.

KATA: this refers to a problem/challenge on codewars.
